## Week 1: Docker, Postgres, pgAdmin, SQL, Terraform

* First week spend mostly setting up environments, loading data into the database and generally becoming familiar with the 'basics' of the tools that will be used in the course.

### Week 1: Key Learning Points ‚≠ê

* Docker: Used for making container environments which help smooth development, putting all packages and dependancies in one place.
* PostgreSQL: Open source relational database system.
* pgAdmin: Allows you to view and investigate the database through a user-friendly web interface.
* SQL: Key for querying structured databases!
* Terraform: Used for automating infrastructure management.


### Week 1: Blog post üíª

* To read some thoughts I had whilst working through week one, as well as more detailed key learning points.

### Week 1: Homework üìö

* Below are the non-code answers for review!

**Question 1Ô∏è‚É£: run docker with the python:3.12.8 image in an interactive mode, use the entrypoint bash. What's the version of pip in the image?**

Run this command in terminal:

`docker run -it --entrypoint bash python:3.12.8`

`pip --version`

**Question 2Ô∏è‚É£: Given the following docker-compose.yaml, what is the hostname and port that pgadmin should use to connect to the postgres database?**

[Link to full question](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2025/01-docker-terraform/homework.md)

Answer:

db:5432


**Question 3Ô∏è‚É£: During the period of October 1st 2019 (inclusive) and November 1st 2019 (exclusive), how many trips, respectively, happened:**

* Up to 1 mile
* In between 1 (exclusive) and 3 miles (inclusive),
* In between 3 (exclusive) and 7 miles (inclusive),
* In between 7 (exclusive) and 10 miles (inclusive),
* Over 10 miles


* To add the data for green taxi's and for zones I added these commands into the terminal:
```
# Adding green taxi data
python Week1_IngestingDataAndPostgres.py \
    --user=root \
    --password=root \
    --host=localhost\
    --port=5432 \
    --db=ny_taxi \
    --table_name=green_taxi_trips \
    --url="https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-10.csv.gz"


# Adding zones table
python Week1_IngestingDataAndPostgres.py \
    --user=root \
    --password=root \
    --host=localhost\
    --port=5432 \
    --db=ny_taxi \
    --table_name=zones \
    --url="https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/misc/taxi_zone_lookup.csv"


# for green taxis change df.tpep_pickup_datetime to df.lpep_pickup_datetime
# for zones, remove the datestamp lines
```

* up to one mile:

```

        WHERE lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2019-10-01'
          AND lpep_pickup_datetime < '2019-11-01'
          AND trip_distance <= 1

        UNION ALL

            yt."DOLocationID", 
            yt."tip_amount" AS total_tip
        FROM yellow_taxi_data yt
        JOIN zones z_pickup ON yt."PULocationID" = z_pickup."LocationID"
        JOIN zones z_drop ON yt."DOLocationID" = z_drop."LocationID"
        WHERE DATE(yt."tpep_pickup_datetime") >= '2019-10-01'
          AND DATE(yt."tpep_pickup_datetime") < '2019-11-01'
          AND z_pickup."Zone" = 'East Harlem North'
    ) AS tips_per_trip
JOIN zones z_drop ON tips_per_trip."DOLocationID" = z_drop."LocationID"
